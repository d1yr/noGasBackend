# README

11/24/20 11am Skeleton mostly there, after redux scrap,
delete action not a priority, working on persisting submissions, 
submissions without reload, and favorites right now. have to find a way
to show and hide forms, as well. the favorites number functionality 
should be a function of the array's length, use a helper function to do that.
need to make an edit function for members as well.
